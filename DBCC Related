-- DBCC Shirink files

This command moves all data from the specified file to other files within the same filegroup, so that the file becomes completely empty. Afterward, you can safely remove it with ALTER DATABASE ... REMOVE FILE.
-- if it is the 1st file of the database, it can be removed

DBCC SHRINKFILE (LogicalFileName, EMPTYFILE);


--You can check if the file still contains data:
-- Execute in the context of a database

SELECT file_id, type_desc, name, size
FROM sys.database_files
WHERE name = 'LogicalFileName';


-- Or, check for pages still in the file:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS PagesInFile
FROM sys.dm_db_database_page_allocations(DB_ID(), NULL, NULL, NULL, 'DETAILED')
WHERE allocated_page_file_id = FILE_ID('LogicalFileName');
