-- DBCC Trace flags

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16

Trace flags are set ON or OFF by using either of the following methods:

Using the DBCC TRACEON and DBCC TRACEOFF commands.

For example, to enable the 2528 trace flag globally, use DBCC TRACEON with the -1 argument: DBCC TRACEON (2528, -1). 
The effect of enabling a global trace flag with DBCC TRACEON is lost on server restart. To turn off a global trace flag, use DBCC TRACEOFF with the -1 argument.

Using the -T startup option to specify that the trace flag is set on during startup.

The -T startup option enables a trace flag globally. You can't enable a session-level trace flag by using a startup option. 
This ensures the trace flag remains active after a server restart. For more information about startup options, see Database Engine Service startup options.

At the query level, by using the QUERYTRACEON query hint. The QUERYTRACEON option is only supported for Query Optimizer 
trace flags documented in the table appearing later in this article.

Use the DBCC TRACESTATUS command to determine which trace flags are currently active.
